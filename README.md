# What is this?

This is just a collection of the stuff I programmed when I was learning off of FreeCodeCamp.  I was storing all of this on a usb drive, and thought hey, why don't I learn how to use Git while I'm learning!

So that's what this is: all the projects I did as well as me recreating the code I learned without the help of FreeCodeCamp.
